%% The abstract is a short summary of the work to be presented in the
%% article.
\begin{abstract}
A good demonstration submission should be interesting to a SIGIR audience and should show a novel solution to a problem. The demonstration submission should address the following questions: Who is your target user? Why does your system exist and why is it important? What does your demonstration do and how does it work? What does it look like? How does it compare with existing systems? Finally, how and when might your technology have an impact, either technically or commercially?

\section{Problem and Target Users}

 - many chat services offered today provide search as a value-add to prompt users to upgrade to paid plans
 
 - many of these services also offer an API that enables bots to read messages in real-time
 
 - the search offering provided by these services is often sub-par: they allow only to search for the exact messages one might have in mind, prevent searching through historical chats, ...
 
 - as search practitioners, we often want to understand how search systems work in order to improve them.
 
 - to this end, we propose an interface for studying and using \textit{search for conversations}.
 
 - search for conversations is a task where one wishes to find a conversation they had in the past.
 
 - Often, chat services provide only search for individual messages: this is not ideal as the messages surrounding a target message often contain context to the information need.
 
 - An example of this is looking for an answer to a question, but forgetting how the question was posed. To find their answer, one may search for a conversation they knew that happened within the same time period.
 
 - Our interface targets users of chat services that wish to provide their own search solution, and Information Practitioners that wish to study how users search for conversations.
