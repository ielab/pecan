\section{Comparison with Existing Systems}

\todo{5th priority: for @kq: start with bullet points, find any related systems describe how they are similar with our system or different from our system. good to have, not a minumum: cite 10-15 paper, 2-3 paragraphs}
 
	• In \cite{10.1145/1148170.1148180:1}, the authors used a single-pass clustering algorithm and it's variations to do thread detection.
	 
	• In \cite{khan2002mining:2}, the authors also mentioned three ways to extract items or topics from a chat messages. The simplest approach is to separate the chat based on time range. This approach does not work very well because conversations are usually not continuous. The second approach is to use topic segmentors to identify conversational flows as threads. However, much information can be lost when separating contents into groups. The revised approach is to classify threads into thread starts and non-thread starts and attach non-thread starts to appropriate thread starts. 
	
	• The article \cite{magnani2012conversation:3} introduces a model to define on-line conversation and distinguish it from off-line conversation.
